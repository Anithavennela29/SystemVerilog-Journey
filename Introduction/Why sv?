SystemVerilog (SV) is an enhanced version of Verilog that combines hardware description and verification into a single language. Here’s why it’s preferred over Verilog:

Memory is allocated during comiplation time in verilog,whereas  in sv,it is allocated during runtime. 
1️⃣ Advanced Verification Capabilities
🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Enables efficient testbench creation using classes and inheritance.
🔹 Randomization – Simplifies test scenario generation using constrained-random stimulus.
🔹 Assertions (SVA) – Helps in verifying design functionality with powerful property checks.
🔹 Functional Coverage – Measures test completeness and improves verification efficiency.

2️⃣ Improved RTL Design Features
🔹 Strongly Typed Data Types – Supports bit, logic, and int for better synthesis and simulation.
🔹 Enums & Structs – Makes code more readable and avoids hardcoded values.
🔹 Interfaces – Reduces wiring complexity and improves modularity.
🔹 Packed & Unpacked Arrays – Offers flexibility in memory representation.

3️⃣ Productivity & Readability Enhancements
🔹 Better always_ff, always_comb, and always_latch – Avoids unintended latches.
🔹 Simplified Fork-Join Constructs – Enables efficient parallel execution.
🔹 Improved Procedural Blocks (foreach, inside, implication keywords) – Enhances readability and reduces coding effort.

4️⃣ Industry Standard for Verification (UVM)
🔹 SystemVerilog is the backbone of the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), widely used in industry for functional verification.
🔹 Verilog lacks built-in support for sophisticated testbenches, making SV essential for large-scale projects.


Verilog Example (verilog_example.v)

module dff (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input d,
    output reg q
);
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
        q <= 0;
    else
        q <= d;
end
endmodule


🔹 SystemVerilog Example (systemverilog_example.sv)

module dff (
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);
always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
        q <= 0;
    else
        q <= d;
end
endmodule
Key Differences
1️⃣ Uses logic instead of reg for better simulation consistency.
2️⃣ Uses always_ff instead of always for better synthesis and linting.
